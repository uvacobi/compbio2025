--- ## Compressing BigBed files > The compression would not be very efficient if
each item was compressed separately, and it would not support random access if
the entire data area were compressed all at once. Instead the regions between
indexed items (containing 512 items by default) are individually compressed.
This maintains the same degree of random accessibility that was enabled by the
sparse R tree index while still achieving nearly the same level of compression
as compressing the entire file would.

<span class="fragment">Why?</span>

--- ## Strategies for scalability 1. compression 2. indexing --- ## Terminology
- **interval**: a location on a sequence defined by a *start* and *end* -
**region**: often used as a synonym of *interval* - **chromosome**: In the
context of genomic intervals, *chromosome* is often used to indicate the *name
of the sequence* on which an interval is defined, but this is really a fudging -
**interval set** or **region set**: a set of intervals/regions ---

## Peaks ![](images/genomic-intervals/peaks.svg) Genomic intervals are often
colloquially referred to as 'peaks'. --- ## Peaks

system**: a set of sequence names and lengths

--- ## File formats for genomic intervals -

[GFF2](http://gmod.org/wiki/GFF2),

- Used for storing transcripts, exons, *etc.* - Many custom variations! --- ###
BED (Browser Extensible Data) - originally designed by UCSC for the genome
browser - but, also often used for analysis - a TSV file with one row per
genomic region - 3 required columns: `chrom`, `chromStart`, and `chromEnd`
Example of BED3 file: ``` chr1 15 250 chr2 38252 49502 ``` --- ## BED - 9
additional optional fields: - name: name of region - score: range 0-1000 -
strand: `+`, `-`, or `.` - thickStart - thickEnd - itemRgb: display color (e.g.
`55,0,0`) - blockCount - blockSizes - blockStarts --- ## BED - BED3 is a BED
with the first 3 columns - BED6 is `chrom`, `chromStart`, and `chromEnd`,
`name`, `score`, `strand` --- ## narrowPeak - 10 Columns - First 6 match BED:
`chrom`, `chromStart`, and `chromEnd`, `name`, `score`, `strand` - Final 4:
`signalValue`, `pValue`, `qValue`, `peak` - `peak`: Point-source (summit);
offset from chromStart. ``` chr1 9356548 9356648 . 0 . 182 5.0945 -1 50 chr1
9358722 9358822 . 0 . 91 4.6052 -1 40 chr1 9361082 9361182 . 0 . 182 9.2103 -1

data with constant size - Fixed-step - regular spacing between - Variable-step -

--- ## Terminology - **intersection** - **union** - **overlap** --- ###
Biological questions, interval computations - Is SNP $s$ located in a promoter
element? - What is the nearest gene downstream of SNP $s$? - What is the average
distance to genes for SNP set $S$? --- ### Biological questions, interval
computations - Which TF binding sites overlap region $r$? - Are binding sites of
TF $y$ enriched in enhancers? - How many sites of TF $y$ are within 10 kb of
gene $z$? --- ### Biological questions, interval computations - What is the
*shape* of signal across interval set $I$? - What is the frequency of
annotations for interval set $I$? - How many aligned reads mapped to gene $g$?
--- # Overlap Does $A$ overlap with $B$? $ A \overset{?}\cap B > 0$
![](images/genomic-intervals/intervals-intersect.svg) ---
![](images/genomic-intervals/intervals-intersect.svg) $A_{start} = 5$ &nbsp;
$A_{end} = 25$ &nbsp; $B_{start} = 23$ &nbsp; $B_{end} = 30$ $cond 1: A_{end}

<span class="fragment"> $cond 2: A_{start} \overset{?}< B_{end}$ </span>

--- Assume: 1. Intervals are well-formed ($X_{start} < X_{end}$) 2. Intervals
are ordered by start ($A_{start} < B_{start}$) $A_{start} < B_{start} $ (order)
$B_{start} < B_{end} $ (well-formed) $\implies A_{start} < B_{end}$ (trans.
property) Then: if $ A_{end} > B_{start}$ $ \implies A \cap B > 0$ --- #

max(A_{end}, B_{end})$ --- ### Key take-away If we make some assumptions, like
pre-computing order, we can do things more efficiently.

<div class="fragment">BUT: Beware of containment</div>

--- ### Interval set overlap counting Given: A database intervals:
$i_1,i_2,...\in\textbf{I}$, A query interval: $q$, Count the number of intervals
in $\textbf{I}$ overlapping $q$. Application: What is the RNA-seq expression
level of gene $g$?

<pre class="fragment"><code data-line-numbers="1-9">def overlap(query, i):
	return query.start < i.end && query.end > i.start

def count_overlaps(query, intervals_set):
	n_overlaps = 0
	for i in interval_set:
		if overlap(query, i):
			n_overlaps = n_overlaps +1
	return n_overlaps
</code></pre>

---

<pre><code data-line-numbers="6">def overlap(query, i):
	return query.start < i.end && query.end > i.start

def count_overlaps(query, intervals_set):
	n_overlaps = 0
	for i in interval_set:
		if overlap(query, i):
			n_overlaps = n_overlaps + 1
	return n_overlaps

</code></pre>

$O(N)$ $N$ = Number of intervals in database We may have billions of intervals.
Can we do better? --- ## Binary search ```Python def binary_search(array, query,
low, high): pivot = int((low + high)/2) if (low >= high): return False if
(array[pivot] = query): return pivot if (array[pivot] > query): return
binary_search(array, query, low, pivot-1) else: return binary_search(array,
query, pivot+1, high) ``` > Binary search is one of the most powerful ideas in
algorithm design... After only one comparison you can discard one half of all
the names in the book. Twenty comparisons suffice to find any name in the
million-name Manhattan phone book. -*Steven Skiena, The Algorithm Design Manual*
--- ## Binary search - Sequential search: $O(N)$; Binary search: $O(logN)$ -
Requires sorted input (sequential search does not) --- An $O(logN)$ option.
Organize database as two lists:
![](images/genomic-intervals/subject-query-annotated.svg)

<div class="fragment">
    1. Binary search $q_{end}$ vs $\textbf{I}_{start}$ 2. Step backward until no
    more overlaps ![](images/genomic-intervals/binary-search.svg)
</div>

--- Say I have a series of regions in a BED file. Can I do a binary search on
the file on disk?

<div class="fragment">
    Binary search also requires random access. > Random access means the ability
    to access any element directly. This is in contrast to *sequential access*,
    where I can only access elements in sequence.
</div>

<div class="fragment">
    A vanilla BED file does not provide random access. How can we provide random
    access to genomic regions?
</div>

--- ### Strategies for providing random access: - Use memory (an in-memory array
has random access) - Indexing (BigBed) - Data structures: Binary search trees,
etc. --- ### Binary search trees

<div class="mermaid">
    graph TB; A((8))-->B((3)) A-->C((10)) B-->D((2)) B-->E((6)) C-->F((9))
    C-->G((12)) E-->H((5)) E-->I((7))
</div>

- Random access and array *insertion* are enemies. - Insertion in a sorted array
is $O(N)$. - Binary search **trees** have $O(logN)$ search *and* insertion. -
They do not require random access for binary search. --- Hidden assumption: No
containment ![](images/genomic-intervals/subject-query-containment.svg)

search tree: - Nodes have $m$ children - Node values are *boundaries* for
subtrees - Boundaries provide overlap constraints

A flavor of [k-d trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree) - Annotates tree
nodes with a *minimum bounding rectangle* of elements. A query that does not
intersect the bounding rectangle will not intersect any child element. ---

![](images/genomic-intervals/binary-search-maxE.svg) --- ### Compressing BigBed
files > The data regions of the file (but not the index) are compressed using
the same deflate techniques that are used in gzip as implemented in the zlib
library, a very widespread, stable and fast library built into most Linux and
UNIX installations. --- ### GZIP Uses DEFLATE: a combination of LZ77 and Huffman
Coding --- ### Run-length Encoding (RLE) ```R > c(rep(1,20), rep(0,15)) [1] 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 >
rle(c(rep(1,20), rep(0,15))) Run Length Encoding lengths: int [1:2] 20 15 values
: num [1:2] 1 0 ``` --- ### LZ77 Duplicate string elimination 1. Find the
longest repeated sequences in string 2. Replace repeats with relative references
to earlier Input: "The compression and the decompression leave an impression.
Hahahahaha!" Output: "The compression and t [20 | 3] de [22 | 12] leave [28 | 3]
i [42 | 7] . Hah [2 | 7] !"

if each item was compressed separately, and it would not support random access
